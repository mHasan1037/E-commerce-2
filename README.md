# E-commerce-2
This is my second e-commerce website.
<br><br>
I have used html, css, javascript to make this website. The header, footer and some other sections are made as components.
<br><br>
I have saved product information in a json file then I fetched those file in the html file. 
<br><br>
In the first page - popular products section each product has an "add" button. If you click the button, the selected product will be stored in the cart which is above the navbar. I have used localStorage to save and reuse product information there. If you click the "cart" section you will see all the products you have selected. You can delete any product if you want and you can see the total price. In the cart there is a "view cart" button. If you click the button you will be redirect to the cart page. You can see here all your product, price, total, tax, delivery charge etc. If you click the "proceed" button you will be in the "checkout" page. You have to put your information to deliver the product.
