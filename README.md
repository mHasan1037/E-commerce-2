# E-commerce-2
This is my second e-commerce website.
<br><br>
I have used html, css, javascript to make this website. The header and footer is made as a component and then I usded it in every page. There are other common compononts that I have used in different parts of the website like banner, different section.
<br><br>
I have saved product information in a json file then I fetched those file in the html file. In every product there is a "add" button. If you click the button, the selected product will be stored in the cart. I have used localStorage to save and reuse product information.
